            <h1 id="title">Mouse and Cheese</h1>
            <p>It is a word's spelling Game. 
            Basically there is a mouse on the floor with a piece of cheese to the right.<br>
            Your goal is to not let the mouse get to the cheese.<br>
            At the start of the game, you will be provided with several empty underlines in a line.<br>
            You start by guessing what letter is in the word.<br>
            Once you start, there is a board that stores the "guess history" of the wrong letter if the letter doesn't exist.<br>
            If it does exist in the word, the letter would be put on the underline. For each wrong guess, the mouse would move to right.<br>
            If the mouse reaches the cheese, you lose.<br>
            </p>
            <p style="color: navy">
                After you win or lose, you can restart the game by clicking the "Restart" button and then click "Start".<br>
